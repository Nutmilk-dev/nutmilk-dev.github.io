## About This Project

This is a static single-page site intended to parody high-end DTC (direct-to-consumer) product marketing. 
It features mock-luxury branding, tongue-in-cheek copywriting, and minimalist design inspired by premium food sites like Oatly and Blue Bottle—except the product is nut milk, and the satire is intentional. 
There is no build step. No frameworks. Just **HTML**, **CSS**, and a tiny bit of **vanilla JavaScript**.
